The accuracy in notebook is different from the accuracy on kaggle because

The accuracy in notebook is related to my_submission(gender_submission) 

my_submission(assignment 1 submission) gives 75-76 % on kaggle

so if my logistic_submission gives 92-100% accuracy of my_submission
(that means it is so closed to my_submission)

then my logistic_submission gives 75-76% on kaggle like my_submission


*** Notes above to explain what I mean with the accuracy in my notebook.
